#Web Cache
A seamless web cache using [Redis](http://redis.io/) as a backend. The cache
allows the server to avoid making repeated expensive or long-waiting route
handling. This is useful for serving static content or a relatively static
data API.

This module acts as middleware for web servers built on
[Connect](https://npmjs.org/package/connect), such as
[Express](https://npmjs.org/package/express). Other than configuring it in
the web server, it does not require any other custom code. It also has some
sensible defaults so you can hit the ground running.

The cache expires items not accessed after a configurable age.

Note that a Redis server needs to be running for the cache to operate.

##Example

    var express = require('express'),
        cache   = require('web-cache');
    
    var app = express();
    
    app.configure(function () {
        app.use(cache.middleware({
            path:    '/api',
            exclude: [ /ignore\/.*\/path/ ],
            expire:  86400 // One day
        }));
    });
    
    // This path will be cached
    app.get('/api/resource/:id', function (req, res, next) {
        // Fancy-pants calculation
        res.end(/* Large JSON object */);
    });
    
    app.get('/docs/:id');                 // Will NOT be cached
    app.get('/api/list/ignore/:id/path'); // Will NOT be cached
    
    app.listen(3000);
    
## API
The only API call **Web Cache** supports (at the moment) is `middleware`.

###client.middleware(params)
Provides Redis-based caching for the web server. `params` is an associative list with the following supported properties:

* `prefix`: *string* \[default: `web-cache`]  The prefix to use for caching. Useful for running multiple caches on the same server.
  
* `expire`: (*integer*) \[default: `86400`  The age of items (in seconds) at which to expire them from the cache.
  
* `path`: (*string* or *Re  The path matching routes that should be cached.

* `exclude`: *array* of *string  A list of routes which the cache should exclude.

* `host`: *string* \[default: `127.0.0.1`] The Redis host.

* `port`: *string* \[default: `6379`] The Redis port.

* `clean`: *boolean* \[default: `false`] Remove all currently-cached items.

##Limitations
The following are temporary and are being implemented, or thought about.

* Only supports JSON content for the moment.
* Will not cache multiple chunks from streaming responses.
* No limit on size or count of cached items.
* NO TESTS! (Yet)
